# Basic Node.js Server with Express

This is a basic example of a Node.js server using the Express framework to serve static files and handle different routes.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to use Express to:

- Serve static files (such as HTML) from a 'public' directory.
- Handle a root route ('/') that reads the content of 'index.html' and sends it as the response, as well as additional links such as "about", "contact me", "error page".

## Project Structure

- index.js: The main server file containing the Express application setup.
- public/: Directory to store static files such as index.html, about.html, contactMe.html, 404.html
